This is a Restful API ultising ExpressJS and using handlebars as a view template. 
I'm using MongoDB as a database to connect to.
In order to run: use node server.js in terminal, all node-modules are included for ease of use but may increase the time needed to download this folder.
Once the server is running, then go in a browser, and search "http://localhost:3000".
This application uses routes, models and controllers found in app folder
Public contains resources used in the view for the UI.

This project is supposed to be a single paged application which allows for CRUD functionallity over 3 collections.
tutorials, tutors and students
Currently the view only shows the information on students and search functionality, which the update and delete buttons yet to be complete.
I am continuing working and learning about multiy tiered systems and databases.
The layout for each collection can be found in the database text document.


This uses:
mongoose, handlebars,express, jquery, bootstrap body-parser and cors,
Exact versions can be found in public or package.json
