This algorithm prints the factorial of the inputted number n and uses BigIntegers to solve to large 
factorials.

The O notation of this algorithm n, where n is the inputed number.
The algorithm loops while multiplying num by a, where num is n converted to BigInteger format and
a is a BigInteger starting at one. Then num is decreased by one each loop.
