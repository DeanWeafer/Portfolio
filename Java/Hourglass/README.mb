Given a 6 by 6 array of values, this algorithm picks out 16 hourglass patterns and finds the sum
of all the values within each hourglass and then prints the largest sum to the screen.

An hourglass is the a sum of values in the shape

abc
 d
efh

The algorithm has two loops, so the O notation of this algorithm is n^2, although the loops are set
to only run 16 times because that is the amount of values that can be compared in a 6 by 6 array.
